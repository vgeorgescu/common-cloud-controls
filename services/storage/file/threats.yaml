    title: Data exfiltration or manipulation via insecure file system protocols
    description: |
      Traditional file system protocols like NFS (Network File System) and SMB
      (Server Message Block) could have vulnerabilities that allow data to be
      exfiltrated or destroyed prematurely, resulting in a loss of availability
      and potential exposure of sensitive data.

    title: Symbolic Link (Symlink) Attacks
    description: |
      File storage services may be vulnerable to symlink attacks, where an attacker
      creates a symbolic link pointing to sensitive or restricted areas of the file
      system. Exploiting symlinks can allow unauthorized access or data manipulation.

    title: Improper handling of file locks or race conditions
    description: |
       File storage services support file locking mechanisms to manage concurrent
       access to files. Improper handling of file locks or race conditions can lead
       to data corruption or unauthorized overwriting of files.
